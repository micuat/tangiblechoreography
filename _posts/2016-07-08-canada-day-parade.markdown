As a dancer, I participated in Canada Day Parade on July 1st, 2016 as a member of [Komachi Montreal]( http://www.komachimontreal.com/ ), a traditional Japanese dance group, with [Arashi Daiko and Inazuma Daiko]( http://www.arashidaiko.org/ ), performing Sansa and Yose Daiko. My interest in dance and technology is not limited to contemporary dance, so I filmed 360-degree videos of the traditional dance during the parade to be viewed by Google Chrome on a computer or an Android phone with a Google Cardboard if you have one. Unfortunately I was taking the camera all the time so there are no videos of myself dancing. Instead, dance videos during a practice are inserted.

I am going to Vienna on July 12th and participate in [danceWEB]( http://www.lifelongburning.eu/projects/danceweb_scholarships.html ) workshop to learn contemporary dance as a visual artist among emerging dancers and choreographers. I am still a bit overwhelmed, but through performing dance with Komachi Montreal and learning contact improvisation with the local group, I am ready to go. I will continue to capture and upload 360 videos during danceWEB, so stay tuned. Finally, as you can see the gauge on the top page, I am lacking funds for the workshop, so I appreciate your donation.
